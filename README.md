# Autoclicker C / RubyClicker

I rlly just made this cus I didn't like the UI of most autoclickers out there. There are better projects out there.

# **RUN AS ADMIN IF YOU WANT SELF DESTRUCT TO WORK (kinda)**

Code is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DqX8fT1DrA

Noticed there wasnt a repo on github so figured id make one

self-destruct **kinda** works, worked for me lol. ** was not tested against any _**paid**_ SS tools **

**REQUIREMENTS** (Only to edit src, app can run with JUST .exe)

Siticone.UI 

gunaUI.2


**self destruct**

The way self destruct works is it spawns a cmd file to delete all files. *i think?* this is ss proof? i honestly have no idea. like i said i made this for the ui not to be ss proof lol. if someone wants to take the time to look at how other projects do it and copy it here, feel free. I just don't care about Minecraft enough.
